The goal of GitBuilding is to give you the freedom to write instructions in the form and structure that you want using markdown. Some extra syntax is added to generate the difficult things like bills of materials.

In GitBuilding you are able to:

* Write the instructions as you go along in markdown
* Tag links in the code with meta-data to show if they are steps in the build or parts that are needed
* Define a library including the part numbers for multiple suppliers
* Syntax for adding in bill of materials

**Note: While we work out the best syntax, major things might change!** If you have syntax suggestions please [raise an issue](https://gitlab.com/bath_open_instrumentation_group/git-building/issues).
