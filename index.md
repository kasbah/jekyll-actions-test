GitBuilding is an open source program for writing hardware documentation.

We are in the early stages of development and the syntax still may change. If you want to get involved please visit the [project on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitbuilding/gitbuilding) or get in contact via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gitbuilding/community).
